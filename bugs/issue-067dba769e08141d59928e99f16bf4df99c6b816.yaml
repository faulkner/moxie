    http://www.mnot.net/python/RSS.py is convenient for this sort of things.
    
    If we pull it as a dependency, it needs to be registered properly in the setup.py.
    
    I think setuptools can do direct URL based dependencies.
    
    Furthermore, I think there is a URL schema of http://www.mnot.net/python/RSS.py?version=blahlblah
    
    So we can lock to it properly.
